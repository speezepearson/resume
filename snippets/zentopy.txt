Zentopy was a cloud file storage service emphasizing ability to share files over many channels. I wrote:
- Back-end code to handle incoming HTTP requests and manage customized database-stored filesystems (in Python, using MongoDB).
- Front-end code to display/modify the files (HTML, CSS, JS, using AngularJS).
