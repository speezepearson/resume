To whom it may concern,

I want to write software for you, and believe you will find me exceptionally useful:

\begin{itemize}
\item I have over a decade of experience both professionally developing software and programming independently, in Python, Java, Ruby, and a variety of other languages. I have used Git and Bash extensively almost every day during this period.
\item I am practiced at working as part of a team to write code for both front- and back-ends of a SaaS product, as a result of my recent work at AppFolio (a SaaS company targeting property managers).
\item While earning my masterâ€™s degree at the University of Washington, I successfully led a multi-year software-engineering research effort focused on building better debugging tools; this involved coordinating among my five collaborators and designing, developing, and documenting much of the code for our experiments. I also wrote scripts to issue and monitor hundreds of thousands of CPU-hours of computation using AWS EC2 and S3.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
This real-world experience, along with the speed with which I can familiarize myself with new conceptual frameworks  (as my references can attest to) and the emphasis I place on effective communication and maintainability (evidenced by the thorough documentation of my personal projects), will make me very valuable to you.

I've attached my r\'esum\'e, which describes my qualifications in more detail. I can be reached at any time by phone or email.

Thank you for your time! I look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely, \\
Spencer Pearson
