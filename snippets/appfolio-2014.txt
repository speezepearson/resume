I worked on AppFolioâ€™s reporting system, which lets clients run complex SQL queries and view the results in a browser.

This involved:
- Writing a completely new front-end, to present the results and allow easy manipulation of them. (CoffeeScript, jQuery)
- Server-side changes to accommodate the new front-end and integrate it more tightly with the rest of the application. (Ruby, Rails)
