% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Reduced testing cycle from \textbf{weeks} to \textbf{hours} by aggressively automating test processes, enabling faster deployments with higher confidence so that AWS and amazon.com can continue to scale under accelerating demand.
\item Increased reliability and replication of both hardware and software qualification by formalizing, automating, and logging test conditions and outcomes.
\item Mentored coworkers in Python, pytest, and git to enable rapid conversion of manual to automated tests, saving thousands of engineer-hours.
\item Built custom tools to automate management of niche hardware, including industrial traffic generators, L1 switches, and bleeding-edge network hardware not yet available to the public, allowing previously time-consuming processes to be automated.
\item Introduced continious deployment, creating automatic end-to-end pipelines with unit and integration testing for software under test and internal testing infrastructure.
\item Developed AWS Test Region to more accurately reflect actual AWS Regions.
\item Increased testing capacity via novel Docker deployment, enabling hardware tests to run concurrently, in isolation, on the same hardware.

\begin{tightemize}
\item Built custom scraping tool to intelligently capture nightly snapshots of web pages and compare differences across time; Used by researchers, debate prep, OFA CTO Harper Reed.
\item Built, deployed, and proactively responded to thousands of internal metrics, ensuring that voter databases, get-out-the-vote infrastructure, web pages, and more remainied available under rapidly growing traffic, constant deployments, and increasingly frequent attacks.
\item Revamped backup solution: increased fidelity, decreased execution time 70\% and storage required 60\%.
\item Performed empirical cost-benefit analysis between different deployment strategies of voter database (NARWAL), saving hundreds of thousands of dollars.
\item Deployed and managed Vertica cluster powering the NARWAL voter database.
\item Collaborated with OFA on one of the then-most-complex AWS deployments ever; visual summary at \href{http://www.jaibot.com/awsofa}{jaibot.com/awsofa}
