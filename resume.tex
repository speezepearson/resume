\item Rearchitected ingestion of run-data, the app's lifeblood and oldest and crustiest ingestion flow, to greatly increase scalability and support newly-necessary forms of parallelism
\item Architected and implemented much of a new storage backend for run-data, transforming multiple major customers' experience from "almost unusably slow" to "quite snappy"
% \item Mentored multiple junior engineers
